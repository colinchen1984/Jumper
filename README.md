Jumper
======

This is a modified version of the pathfinding library [Jumper](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper/blob/master). <br/>
It features the same features as the official release. The specific change is an experimental feature included to support tiles with specific rules of walkability, such as one-way tiles.

##Installation
The current repository can be retrieved locally on your computer using the following bash script:

```bash
git clone -b experimental git://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper.git --recursive
````

##Usage##
###Adding Jumper to your project###
Copy this repository contents in a folder named __Jumper__ and put it inside your projet. Use *require* function to call the library.

```lua
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
```

**Note** :  You can add __.init.lua__ in your <tt>package path</tt>. As a result, requiring __Jumper__ will become easier.

```lua
package.path = package.path .. ';.\\?\\init.lua'
local Jumper = require ('Jumper')
```
	
**Note** : Some frameworks, like [LÃ¶ve][] already includes  __.\init.lua__ in their <tt>package.path</tt>. In this case, you can just use :

```lua
local Jumper = require('Jumper')
```

###Initializing Jumper###

To initialize the pathfinder, you will have to pass __four values__. 

```lua
local allowDiagonal = true
local pather = Jumper(map,allowDiagonal,heuristicName,autoFill)
```

Only the first argument is __required__, the __others__ left are __optional__:

* __map__ refers to the matrix representing the 2D world.
* __allowDiagonal__ is a boolean saying whether or not *diagonal moves* are allowed. Will be considered as __true__ if not given.
* __heuristicName__ is a predefined string constant representing the *distance heuristic function* to be used for path computation.
* __autoFill__ is a boolean to __enable or not__ for [automatic path filling](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper/#automatic-path-filling).

###Setting your collision map
####The collision map table
The collision map is a regular 2-dimensional Lua table. All rows and columns __must be indexed__ with __consecutive integers__.<br/>
In this table, __each value__ is a __byte__ (*i.e an integer number between 0 and 255*). This value would represent two things:

* __whether or not__ a moving entity __can walk on__ the corresponding tile,
* when the tile is walkable, __from which direction__ this tile __can be entered__.
 
####Byte values : the basic rules
On a regular 2D map, an entity can move in __8 directions__:

* __orthogonally__: *north* (up), *south* (down), *west* (left), *east* (right),
* __Diagonally__: *north-east*, *south-east*, *north-west*, *south-west*.

We can represent this as follows:

<center><img src="http://ompldr.org/vZnhhZA" alt="" width="163" height="62" border="0" /></center>

And thus, map each of these directions with the following values:

<center><img src="http://ompldr.org/vZnhhZQ" alt="" width="163" height="62" border="0" /></center>

So, when we affect to a cell a byte-value of __2__, it means this tile __can only be entered from the North__. A byte-value of __128__ would mean this tile __can only be entered from South-East__.

####Composition rules
Say that we want a tile to be entered from __both North and South__ directions, or __both East and West__...How would we proceed ?<br/>

First, we will start calling __Jumper__, then load a third-party named *bitops.lua*.

```lua
local Jumper = require ('Jumper.init')
local Dir = require 'bitops '
```
First, consider these assumptions :

* Byte 255 corresponds to a fully walkable tile
* Byte 0 corresponds to a fully unwalkable tile (tile that cannot be crossed)

*bitops.lua* returns a table containing three functions:

* AND (...)
* OR (...)
* NOT (...)

These functions will help you baking __the desired byte value__ to be set to a cell on a collision map. Yet, they are very easy to use.

* *Tile A* can be entered from *North or South or West or East*:

```lua
local byteA = Dir.OR(2,64,8,16)
```

* Now we want *Tile A* to remain as it is, but disable entry from *north-west* :

```lua
local byteB = Dir.AND(byteA,Dir.NOT(1))
```

* *Tile B* can be entered __from anywhere but__ *west, east or south-east*:

```lua
local byteB = Dir.NOT(8, 16,128)
```

* We want *Tile B* to remain as it is, but allow entry from *west*:

```lua
local byteB = Dir.OR(byteB,8)
```

And that's it!



###Distance heuristics###

*Jumper* features three (3) distance heuristics.

* MANHATTAN Distance : *|dx| + |dy|*
* EUCLIDIAN Distance : *sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)*
* DIAGONAL Distance : *max(|dx|, |dy|)*

By default, when you init  *Jumper*, __MANHATTAN__ will be used by default if 
no heuristic was specified.<br/>
If you want to use __another distance heuristic__, you will have to pass one of the following predefined strings:

```lua
"MANHATTAN" -- for MANHATTAN Distance
"EUCLIDIAN" -- for EUCLIDIAN Distance
"DIAGONAL" -- for DIAGONAL Distance
```

As an example :

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Heuristics. = require 'Jumper.core.heuristics'
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal,'EUCLIDIAN')
```

You can __alternatively__ use <tt>pather:setHeuristic(Name)</tt>:

```lua
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
pather:setheuristic('EUCLIDIAN')
```

##Public interface##

###Pathfinder class interface

Once Jumper was loaded and initialized properly, you can used one of the following methods listed below.<br/>
__Assuming <tt>pather</tt> represents an instance of <tt>Jumper</tt> class.__
	
#####pather:setHeuristic(NAME)
Will change the *distance heuristic* used.<br/>
__NAME__ must be passed as a string. Possible values are *MANHATTAN, EUCLIDIAN, DIAGONAL* (case-sensitive!).

* Argument __NAME__: *string*
* Returns: *nil*

#####pather:getHeuristic() 
Will return a reference to the *distance heuristic function* internally used.<br/>

* Argument: *nil*
* Returns: *function*

#####pather:setDiagonalMoves(Bool)
Argument must be a *boolean*. *True* will allow diagonal moves, *false* will allow *only straight-moves*.<br/>

* Argument __Bool__: *boolean*
* Returns: *nil*

#####pather:getDiagonalMoves()
Returns a *boolean* saying whether or not diagonal moves are allowed.

* Argument: *nil*
* Returns: *boolean*

#####pather:getGrid()
Returns a reference to the *internal grid* used by the pathfinder.
This grid is __not__ the map matrix given on initialization, but a __virtual representation__ used internally.

* Argument: *nil*
* Returns: *grid* (regular Lua table)

#####pather:getPath(startX,startY,endX,endY)
Main function, returns a path from location *[startX,startY]* to location*[endX,endY]* as an __ordered array__ of tables (*{x = ...,y = ...}*).<br/>
Otherwise returns *nil* if there is __no valid path__.<br/>
Also returns a __second value__ representing the __total cost of the move__ when a path was found.

* Argument __startX__: *integer*
* Argument __startY__: *integer*
* Argument __endX__: *integer*
* Argument __endY__: *integer*
* Returns: *path* (regular Lua table) or *nil*
* Returns: *cost* or *nil*

#####pather:fill(Path)
Polishes a path

* Argument __Path__: *path* (regular Lua table)
* Returns: *path* (regular Lua table)

#####pather:setAutoFill(bool)
Turns *on/off* the __autoFilling__ feature. When *on*, paths returned with <tt>pather:getPath()</tt> will always be automatically polished with <tt>pather:fill()</tt>

* Argument __bool__: *boolean*
* Returns: *nil*

#####pather:getAutoFill()
Returns the status of the __autoFilling__ feature

* Argument __bool__: *nil*
* Returns: *boolean*

###Grid class interface

<tt>pather:getGrid()</tt> returns a reference to the *internal grid* used by the pathfinder.
On this reference, you can use one of the following methods.<br/>

__Assuming *grid* holds the returned value from <tt>pather:getGrid()</tt>__

#####grid:getNodeAt(x,y)
Returns a reference to *node (X,Y)* on the grid.

* Argument __x__: *integer*
* Argument __y__: *integer*
* Returns: *node* (regular Lua table)

#####grid:isWalkableAt(x,y,ux,uy)

* Argument __x__: *integer*
* Argument __y__: *integer*
* Argument __ux__: *integer* (either 0 or 1)
* Argument __uy__: *integer* (either 0 or 1)

* Argument __y__: *integer*
* Argument __walkable__: *boolean*
* Returns: *nil*

#####grid:getNeighbours(node,allowDiagonal)
Returns an array list of *nodes neighbouring node (X,Y)*. 
This list will include or not adjacent nodes regards to the boolean *allowDiagonal*.

* Argument __node__: *node* (regular Lua table)
* Argument __allowDiagonal__: *boolean*
* Returns: *neighbours* (regular Lua table)


##Handling paths##

###Using native <tt>pather:getPath()</tt>###

Using <tt>pather:getPath()</tt> will return a table representing a path from one node to another.<br/>
The path is stored in a table using the form given below:

```lua
path = {
          {x = 1,y = 1},
          {x = 2,y = 2},
          {x = 3,y = 3},
          ...
          {x = n,y = n},
        }
```

You will have to make your own use of this to __route your entities__ on the 2D map along this path.<br/>
Note that the path could contains some *holes* because of the algorithm used.<br/>
However, this __will not cause any issue__ as the move from one step to another along this path is __always straight__.<br/>
You can accomodate of this by yourself, or use the __path filling__ feature.

###Path filling###

__Jumper__ provides a __path filling__ feature that can be used to polish a path early computed, filling the holes it may contain.

```lua  
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
local path, length = pather:getPath(1,1,3,3)
-- Just pass the path to pather:fill().
pather:fill(path)
```

###Automatic path filling###
This feature will trigger the <tt>pather:fill()</tt> everytime <tt>pather:getPath()</tt> will be called.<br/>
Yet, it is very simple to use:

```lua  
local walkable = 0
local allowDiagonal = true
local Jumper = require('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,walkable,allowDiagonal)
pather:setAutoFill(true)
local path, length = pather:getPath(1,1,3,3)
-- No need to use path:fill() now !
```

##Chaining##
All setters can be chained.<br/>
This is convenient if you need to __reconfigure__ the pather instance in a __quick and elegant manner__.

```lua 
local Jumper = require ('Jumper.init')
-- Assuming map is defined
local pather = Jumper(map,0)
-- some code
-- calling the pather, reconfiguring it and yielding a new path
local path,length = pather:setAutoFilltrue)
				   :setHeuristic('EUCLIDIAN')
				   :setDiagonalMoves(true)
				   :getPath(1,1,4,3)
-- That's it!				   
```

##Object-orientation
__Jumper__ uses [30log][] as a lightweight *object-orientation* framework.<br/>
*When loading* Jumper, the path to this third-party library is automatically added, so that you can *require* this third-party very easily if you need it.

```lua
local Jumper = require 'Jumper.init'
local Class = require '30log'
```
